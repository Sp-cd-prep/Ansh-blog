The best move for developing those big, fan-shaped muscles (latissimus dorsi, aka, the lats) that make your shoulders look wide is the traditional pullup. It’s a big, multijoint move, which leads to testosterone release, meaning strength and overall muscle development will be enhanced.",

        "description": "Some guys work for a lifetime to develop a ripped midsection like the fitness models we see in magazines. Others know the secret of disciplined eating and the best exercises for abs out there, none of which are a crunch or variation. The medicine ball slam carves out gorges in the midsection, making your abs look like a street map of midtown Manhattan and adds a good amount of cardio to your workout so you can maintain that look",

        "description": "Although very challenging, the Swiss ball rollout is an essential part of anyone’s quest for a six-pack. As you roll out on the ball, your abs are put under increasing tension, and any fitness expert knows that one of the secrets to building ripped, lean muscle is high muscular tension. Use this move in place of a crunch to carve out a defined six-pack.",

        "description": "Although this move looks like it would hurt your lower back, it in fact has the opposite effect. The good morning is a great developer for those muscles; and the use of a band makes it more like a physical therapy exercise than a traditional lift. Not only that, but this exercise will assist you in the squat, allowing you to load up more weight on the bar.",

But sometimes, the best workout you can do is just hefting around some heavy stuff. After your workout, try carrying a pair of 70-pound dumbbells around for more than 30 seconds; your forearms will be on fire. After a few weeks of this, you can expect your weights to start increasing faster than ever before.",

Running around the pitch, sprinting between cones or even uphill, jumping over hurdles or … How can something be called ‘football fitness’ but the players are doing everything except playing football? This is yet another symptom of a world without clear terminology and definitions. The solution is simple. Let’s define football fitness.",

At the beginning of the first film, Wick has been retired from being a hitman for five years after undertaking an 'impossible task' for Tarasov, wiping out all other organized crime syndicates in New York City in order to be allowed to leave to marry Helen (Bridget Moynahan) before her eventual death from cancer, leaving him known as a legend in the assassin underworld worldwide.",
